  "raw_response": "To validate the consistency of the provided results and generate a consolidated JSON response, we will analyze each input according to specific rules:\n\n1. **\"utile\" is false**: If \"utile\" is false for any problem (A1 or A4), then gravity should be near 0.\n\n2. The input must provide both a reason (\"Raisonnement\") and an explanation for the problem in natural language, along with the relevant JSON output if it exists.\n\n3. We will consolidate keys from all inputs into a single JSON object based on their relevance to the validation rules.\n\nGiven these rules, let's analyze each input:\n\n- **Input A1**: Contains \"{\\n  \\\"utile\\\": false\\n}\" which indicates gravity should be near 0 because \"utile\" is false.\n\n    - Consolidation: {\"utile\": False, \"gravity\": 0}\n\n- **Input A2**: Describes a situation where the categorization of a problem seems like a positive event (\"une mise \u00e0 jour importante\"), but its relevance to the gravity level isn't explicitly linked. The JSON provided doesn't support direct validation based on \"utile\".\n\n    - This input is partially relevant as it discusses a positive change in service, which could affect gravity.\n\n- **Input A3**: Contains \"{\\n  \\\"sentiment\\\": \\\"colere\\\"}\" which indicates the sentiment of the tweet or situation but does not directly validate gravity level without context about \"utile\".\n\n    - This input adds to our understanding that there's a sense of frustration (\"colere\"), which might imply a need for attention, possibly impacting the gravity level.\n\n- **Input A4**: Contains detailed analysis leading to a JSON output with \"type_probleme\": \"panne\". It mentions an improvement in service (reduction or solution) and implies stability (\"le r\u00e9seau 4G ou Wi-Fi est disponible pour les abonn\u00e9s mobiles Free\"). This suggests gravity should be near 0 due to the resolution of issues.\n\n    - Consolidation: {\"utile\": True, \"gravity\": 0}\n\n- **Input A5**: Contains \"Score de gravit\u00e9 : 0\" indicating that gravity is near 0 without explicitly stating why based on \"utile\".\n\n    - The explanation supports a positive change (\"une nouvelle utile\") but doesn't directly validate the gravity level.\n\nBased on these analyses, here's a consolidated JSON response reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"utile\": false,\n  \"categorie\": \"panne\",\n  \"sentiment\": \"colere\",\n  \"type_probleme\": \"panne\",\n  \"score_gravite\": 0,\n  \"status\": \"success/error\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response combines relevant keys from inputs A1, A2 (which adds contextual information without direct validation), and A4 for a comprehensive view of the problem's context. The gravity level is set to 0 due to the absence of negative indicators (\"utile\" being false or indicating significant risk)."
