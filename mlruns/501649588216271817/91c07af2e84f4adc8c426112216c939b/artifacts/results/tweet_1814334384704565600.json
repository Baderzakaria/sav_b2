The text is not enclosed in double quotes and has inconsistent formatting.\n\nHere's an example of how the input data should be formatted for proper validation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"A1\": \"{\\\"utile\\\": true}\",\n  \"A2\": \"{\\\"categorie\\\": \\\"probleme\\\"}\",\n  \"A3\": \"{\\\"sentiment\\\": \\\"colere\\\"}\",\n  \"A4\": \"{\\\"type_probleme\\\": \\\"resiliation\\\"}\",\n  \"A5\": \"{\\\"score_gravite\\\": -8}\"\n}\n```\n\nWith the correct formatting, I can now validate the consistency of these results.\n\nFirstly, let's check if 'utile' is false. If it is, then gravity should be near 0.\n\nSince utile is true in A1 and there are no other mentions of gravity or utile being false, we assume that gravity is not zero (i.e., it's around 9.8 m/s^2). \n\nNow let's analyze the results:\n\n- Categorie: \"probleme\" for A2.\n- Sentiment: \"colere\" for A3.\n\nThese sentiments match with the user complaining about the service and experiencing trouble contacting the support team, which suggests a need for assistance or resolution. Hence 'utile' is true.\n\nThe score_gravite in A5 indicates that the gravity should be near -8 on the surface of the Earth (which isn't possible as we live on a planet with normal gravitational forces).\n\nHere's consolidated keys: {\"utile\": true, \"categorie\": \"probleme\", \"sentiment\": \"colere\", \"type_probleme\": \"resiliation\", \"score_gravite\": -8, \"status\": \"success/error\"}"
