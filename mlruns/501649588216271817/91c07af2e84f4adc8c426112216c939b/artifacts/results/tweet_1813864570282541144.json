  "raw_response": "To validate the consistency of these results, we will go through each input and determine if 'utile' is false, which should indicate gravity near 0.\n\n1. Input A1:\n   - Result: \"utile\": true\n   - Gravity Check: Since \"utile\" is true, this suggests gravity could be greater than 0. However, without more context or additional information about the tweet's utility and relevance to a specific service, it's difficult to accurately determine its gravity.\n\n2. Input A2:\n   - Result: {\"categorie\": \"retour_client\"}\n   - Gravity Check: This input directly provides a category (\"retour_client\") but doesn't indicate 'utile' being false or gravity near 0 directly. It seems relevant but lacks detail on utility in context.\n\n3. Input A3:\n   - Result: {\"sentiment\": \"frustration\"}\n   - Gravity Check: This indicates frustration but not necessarily a lack of utility ('utile': false). The sentiment alone doesn't dictate gravity, as it could be part of a more comprehensive analysis that considers the overall impact and context.\n\n4. Input A4:\n   - Result: {\"type_probleme\": \"resiliation\"}\n   - Gravity Check: Since 'utile' is not provided in this result, we cannot directly determine its truth value based on gravity alone. However, a problem type of \"resiliation\" implies the issue might be less severe compared to other types.\n\n5. Input A5:\n   - Result: {\"score_gravite\": 4}\n   - Gravity Check: This input indicates a score that suggests gravity near 0 because higher scores typically correspond to more significant problems. However, without the 'utile' value explicitly stated or implied in relation to this score, we cannot definitively conclude its utility.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems there's an inconsistency in how the inputs report 'utile' directly vs. indicating relevance through other factors like sentiment and gravity scores. The direct assertion of 'utile' is missing for most examples, which complicates a straightforward analysis of consistency without additional context or information on what constitutes \"useful\" (or \"utile\") based on provided results.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we're looking for general insights rather than strict consistency across every metric. Here's a consolidated JSON reflecting the implications observed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"utile\": null,\n  \"categorie\": null,\n  \"sentiment\": \"frustration\",\n  \"type_probleme\": \"resiliation\",\n  \"score_gravite\": 4,\n  \"status\": \"inconclusive\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response reflects that, without direct 'utile' validation, we can't conclusively determine gravity or utility ('utile') in all cases. The sentiment and problem type provided offer some insight into the nature of the issue but do not fully address the question asked about consistency with respect to 'utile'."
